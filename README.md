# CODSOFT_TASK_1

Excited to share my latest project as part of my AI internship with CodSoft! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸ˜Š 

I've just completed #CODSOFT_TASK-1  on creating a rule-based chatbot. This project was a part of my internship tasks where I got hands-on experience with AI and chatbot development.

In this video, I walk you through the process of building a simple rule-based chatbot using if-else statements and pattern recognition. It was a fantastic learning experience, and I hope it helps others who are interested in AI and chatbot development.

Special thanks to CodSoft for providing this opportunity and the valuable guidance throughout the internship.

Check out the video and let me know your thoughts!
